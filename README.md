# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
To find data through API calls using diffrent conditons and filters, using City Bikes, Foursquare & Yelp API. 

## Process
### (your step 1) - 
First step in the project is to import all required libraries to get requited functionality needed. In this projetc we are working with city bikes, Foursqaure & Yelp by making API calls. 

### (your step 2) - 
We can extract diffrent pieces of information requitred as per need & put all that into a dataframe.

## Results
With diffrent API calls to City Bikes, Yelp & Foursquare we can extract data & put in data frame. We supplied diffrent conditions with API calls. And also used regression model.

## Challenges 
It was difficlut & time consuming to work with Yelp for some reason.

## Future Goals
I will be using more conditions to get variety of data.
